# Voice-Controlled Assistant 🎤🎬  

A Python-based virtual assistant that listens to your voice commands and opens YouTube with the desired search term. This project utilizes **Google Speech Recognition** for voice-to-text conversion and **pywhatkit** for interacting with multiples options.

## Features 🚀
- Recognizes voice commands in **Portuguese (pt-BR)**.
- Opens YouTube and performs searches based on your spoken instructions.
- Provides synthesized audio feedback using **gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)**.
